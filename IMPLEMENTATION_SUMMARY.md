  "@react-three/drei": "^9.3.0", 
  "three": "^0.158.0"
}
```

## 🧪 System Testing

The implementation has been tested and verified:

- ✅ **Project Discovery**: Successfully detects 1 model file (hydrogen-bike.glb)
- ✅ **Data Generation**: Creates 6 complete project objects
- ✅ **Featured Projects**: 4 featured projects identified
- ✅ **Categories**: 4 categories available (Mechanical Design, Industrial Design, Product Design, Surface Modeling)
- ✅ **Software**: 2 software types (SOLIDWORKS, CATIA)
- ✅ **Data Integrity**: All projects have valid data structure

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Existing Projects
The system automatically works with your existing hydrogen-bike.glb model. Simply:
1. Visit the portfolio page
2. Click on any project card
3. View the interactive 3D model with controls
4. Navigate between projects using arrow keys or buttons

### Adding New Projects
1. **Add 3D Model**: Place `.glb` or `.gltf` file in `/public/models/`
2. **Add Metadata**: Update `utils/projectDiscovery.js` with project information
3. **Automatic Discovery**: System automatically detects and displays new projects

### Example: Adding a New Project
```javascript
// In utils/projectDiscovery.js
'new-project': {
  id: 7,
  title: 'New Project Title',
  category: 'Product Design',
  software: 'SOLIDWORKS',
  description: 'Project description...',
  tags: ['Tag1', 'Tag2'],
  featured: true,
  year: 2024,
  specifications: {
    complexity: 'High',
    parts: '100+ components'
  },
  technicalDetails: [
    'Technical detail 1',
    'Technical detail 2'
  ]
}
```

## 🎨 User Experience Features

### Interactive Controls
- **Mouse/Touch**: Drag to rotate, scroll to zoom, right-click to pan
- **Keyboard**: Arrow keys to navigate between projects, ESC to close modal
- **Auto-rotation**: Models automatically rotate for better viewing
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during model loading

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop**: Full 3D viewer with side-by-side information panel
- **Mobile**: Stacked layout with touch-optimized controls
- **Tablet**: Adaptive layout that works on all screen sizes

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactions
